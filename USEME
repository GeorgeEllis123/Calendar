Once the GUI is opened (follow instructions in README.md file) the user may:
* Click the create to an insert a Subject and valid time (a time is valid if it is in military
format and has HH:mm) and then submit the create command.  This will place the event on the day in
day order of start time if the event is not a duplicate event.  An event is a duplicate event if a
subject and start time matches an existing event on that day.  There is a maximum of 10 events
allowed on one day.
* Click the search button to go to that date on the calendar.  If the date is invalid there should
a pop up that alerts the user that the date that they are attempting to jump to is invalid. Users
can create events on the day that they went to.
* Once a user creates an event they can see an edit button next to event.  The user may edit the
subject, start time, or the end time of these events unless it creates a duplicate event as defined
above.
* To exit the calendar, x out of the pop up.
